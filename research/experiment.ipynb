It is composed of: \\n1. Reasoning \\n2. Learning \\n3. Problem Solving \\n4. Perception \\n5. Linguistic Intelligence \\n \\n \\nLet us go through all the components briefly: \\n1. Reasoning: It is the set of processes that enables us to provide basis for judgement, \\nmaking decisions, and prediction. There are broadly two types: \\nInductive Reasoning Deductive Reasoning \\nIt conducts specific observations to makes \\nbroad general statements. \\nIt starts with a general statement and \\nexamines the possibilities to reach a specific, \\nlogical conclusion. \\nEven if all of the premises are true in a \\nstatement, inductive reasoning allows for the \\nconclusion to be false. \\nIf something is true of a class of things in \\ngeneral, it is also true for all members of that \\nclass.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  8 \\nExample: \\n“Nita is a teacher.  \\nAll teachers are studious.  \\nTherefore, Nita is studious.” \\nExample:  \\n\"All women of age above 60 years  are \\ngrandmothers.  \\nShalini is 65 years.  \\nTherefore, Shalini is a grandmother.\"  \\n \\n2. Learning: It is the activity of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practising, being \\ntaught, or experiencing something . Learning enhances the awareness of the subjects \\nof the study.  \\n    The ability of lea rning is possessed by humans, some animals, and AI -enabled   \\nsystems. Learning is categorized as: \\no Auditory Learning: It is learning by listening and hearing. For example, students \\nlistening to recorded audio lectures. \\n \\no Episodic Learning: To learn by remembering sequences of events that one has \\nwitnessed or experienced. This is linear and orderly. \\n \\no Motor Learning: It is learning by precise movement of muscles. For example, \\npicking objects, Writing, etc. \\n \\no Observational Learning: To learn by watching and imitating others. For example, \\nchild tries to learn by mimicking her parent.   \\n \\no Perceptual Learning: It is learning to recognize stimuli that one has seen before. \\nFor example, identifying and classifying objects and situations. \\n \\no Relational Learning: It involves learning to differentiate among various stimuli \\non the basis of relational properties, rather than absolute properties. For Example, \\nAdding ‘little less’ salt at the time of cooking potatoes that came up salty last time, \\nwhen cooked with adding say a tablespoon of salt.  \\n \\no Spatial learning : It is learning through visual stimuli such as images, colors, \\nmaps, etc. For Example,  A person can create roadmap in mind before actually \\nfollowing the road.  \\n \\no Stimulus-Response Learning: It is l earning to perform a part icular behavior \\nwhen a certain stimulus is present . For example, a dog raises its ear on hearing \\ndoorbell.  \\n3. Problem solving: It is the process in which one perceives and tries to arrive at a \\ndesired solution from a present situation by taking some path, wh ich is blocked by \\nknown or unknown hurdles. \\nProblem solving also includes decision making, which is the process of selecting the \\nbest suitable alternative out of multiple alternatives to reach the desired goal are \\navailable.  \\n4. Perception: It is the process of acquiring, interpreting, selecting, and organizing  \\nsensory information.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  9 \\nPerception presumes sensing. In humans, perception is aided by sensory organs. In \\nthe domain of AI, perception mechanism puts the data acquired by the sensors \\ntogether in a meaningful manner.  \\n5. Linguistic Intelligence: It is one’s ability to use, comprehend, speak, and write the \\nverbal and written language. It is important in interpersonal communication. \\nDifference between Human and Machine Intelligence \\n\\uf0b7 Humans perceive by patterns whereas the machines perceive by set of rules and data. \\n\\uf0b7 Humans store and recall information by patterns, machines do it by searching \\nalgorithms. For example, the number 40404040 is easy to remember, store and recall \\nas its pattern is simple. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Humans can figur e out the complete object even if some part of it is missing or \\ndistorted; whereas the machines cannot correctly.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  10 \\nThe domain of artificial intelligence is huge in breadth and width. W hile proceeding, w e \\nconsider the broadly common and prospering research areas in the domain of AI: \\n \\nSpeech and Voice Recognition \\nThese both terms are common in robotics, expert systems and natural language processing. \\nThough these terms are used interchangeably, their objectives are different. \\nSpeech Recognition Voice Recognition \\nThe s peech recognition aims at \\nunderstanding and comprehend ing WHAT \\nwas spoken. \\nThe objective of voice recognition is to \\nrecognize WHO is speaking. \\nIt is used in hand -free computing, map or \\nmenu navigation \\nIt analyzes person’s t one, voice pitch, and \\naccent, etc., to identify a person. \\nMachine does not need training as it is not \\nspeaker dependent. \\nThe recognition system needs training as it \\nis person-oriented. \\n3. Research Areas of AI'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  11 \\nSpeaker independent Speech Recognition \\nsystems are difficult to develop. \\nSpeaker-dependent Speech Recognition \\nsystems are comparatively easy to develop. \\nWorking of Speech and Voice Recognition Systems  \\nThe user input spoken at a microphone goes to sound card of the system. The converter turns \\nthe analog signal into equivalent digital signal for the speech processing. The database is used \\nto compare the patterns to recognize the words. Finally , a reverse feedback is given to the \\ndatabase. \\nThis source-language text becomes input to the Translation Engine, which converts it to  the \\ntarget language text.

They learn by perce ption, \\nspeaking, using language, and locomotives. They learn Formal Tasks and Expert Tasks later, \\nin that order.  \\nFor humans, the mundane tasks are easiest to learn. The same was considered true before \\ntrying to implement mundane tasks in machines. Earlier , all work of AI was concentrated in \\nthe mundane task domain.  \\nLater, it turned out that the machine requires more knowledge, complex knowledge \\nrepresentation, and complicated algorithms for handling mundane tasks. This is the reason \\nwhy AI work is more pr ospering in the  Expert Task domain now, as the expert task \\ndomain needs expert knowledge without common sense, which can be easier to represent and \\nhandle.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  14 \\nAn AI system is composed of an agent and its environment. The agents ac t in their \\nenvironment. The environment may contain other agents. \\nWhat are Agent and Environment? \\nAn agent is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon that \\nenvironment through effectors.  \\n\\uf0b7 A human agent has sensory organs such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin parallel \\nto the sensors, and other organs such as hands, legs, mouth, for effectors.  \\n\\uf0b7 A robotic agent  replaces cameras and infrared range finders for the sensors , and \\nvarious motors and actuators for effectors.  \\n\\uf0b7 A software agent has encoded bit strings as its programs and actions. \\n \\nAgents T erminology \\n\\uf0b7 Performance Measure of Agent: It is the criteria, which determines how successful \\nan agent is. \\n\\uf0b7 Behavior of Agent: It is the action that agent performs after any given seq uence of \\npercepts. \\n\\uf0b7 Percept: It is agent’s perceptual inputs at a given instance.  \\n\\uf0b7 Percept Sequence: It is the history of all that an agent has perceived till date.  \\n4. Agents and Environments'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  15 \\n\\uf0b7 Agent Function: It is a map from the precept sequence to an action. \\nRationality \\nRationality is nothing but status of being reasonable, sensible, and having good sense of \\njudgment. \\nRationality is concerned with expected actions and results depending upon what the agent has \\nperceived. Performing actions with the aim of  obtaining useful information is an important \\npart of rationality. \\nWhat is Ideal Rational Agent? \\nAn ideal rational agent is the one, which is capable of doing expected actions to maximize its \\nperformance measure, on the basis of: \\n\\uf0b7 Its percept sequence  \\n\\uf0b7 Its built-in knowledge base \\nRationality of an agent depends on the following:  \\n1. The performance measures, which determine the degree of success.  \\n2. Agent’s Percept Sequence till now.  \\n3. The agent’s prior knowledge about the environment.  \\n4. The actions that the agent can carry out.  \\nA rational agent always performs right action, where the right action means the action that \\ncauses the agent to be most successful in the given percept sequence. The problem the agent \\nsolves is characterized by Performance Measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors \\n(PEAS). \\nThe Structure of Intelligent Agents \\nAgent’s structure can be viewed as: \\n• Agent = Architecture + Agent Program \\n• Architecture = the machinery that an agent executes on. \\n• Agent Program = an implementation of an agent function. \\nSimple Reflex Agents \\n\\uf0b7 They choose actions only based on the current percept.  \\n\\uf0b7 They are rational only if a correct decision is made only on the basis of current precept.  \\n\\uf0b7 Their environment is completely observable. \\nCondition-Action Rule – It is a rule that maps a state (condition) to an action.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  16 \\n \\nModel-Based Reflex Agents  \\nThey use a model of the world to choose their actions. They maintain an internal state.  \\nModel: knowledge about “how the things happen in the world”. \\nInternal State: It is a representation of unobserved aspects of current state depending on \\npercept history. \\nUpdating state requires the information about \\n\\uf0b7 How the world evolves. \\n\\uf0b7 How the agent’s actions affect the world.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  17 \\n \\nGoal-Based Agents \\nThey choose their actions in order to achieve goals.

The knowledge engineer also \\nmonitors the development of the ES. \\nInference Engine \\nUse of efficient procedures and rules by the Inf erence Engine is essential in deducting a \\ncorrect, flawless solution.  \\nIn case of knowledge-based ES, the Inference Engine acquires and manipulates the knowledge \\nfrom the knowledge base to arrive at a particular solution.  \\nIn case of rule based ES, it: \\n\\uf0b7 Applies rules repeatedly to the facts, which are obtained from earlier rule application. \\n\\uf0b7 Adds new knowledge into the knowledge base if required. \\n\\uf0b7 Resolves rules conflict when multiple rules are applicable to a particular case  \\nTo recommend a solution, the inference engine uses the following strategies: \\n\\uf0b7 Forward Chaining \\n\\uf0b7 Backward Chaining \\nForward Chaining \\nIt is a strategy of an expert system to answer the question, “What can happen next?”'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  43 \\nHere, the inferance engine follows the chain of conditions and derivations and finally deduces \\nthe outcome. It considers all the facts and rules, and sorts them before  concluding to a \\nsolution.  \\nThis strategy is followed for working on conclusion, result, or effect.  For example, prediction \\nof share market status as an effect of changes in interest rates.  \\n \\nBackward Chaining \\nWith this strategy, an expert system finds ou t the answer to the question , “Why this \\nhappened?” \\nOn the basis of what has already happen ed, the in ference engine tries to find out which \\nconditions could have happened in the past for this result. This strategy is followed for finding \\nout cause or reason. For example, diagnosis of blood cancer in humans.  \\n \\nUser Interface \\nUser interface provides interaction between user of the ES and the ES itself. It is generally \\nNatural Language Processing so as to be used by the user who is well -versed in the task \\ndomain. The user of the ES need not be necessarily an expert in Artificial Intelligence.  \\nIt explains how the ES has arrived at a particular recommendation. The explanation may in \\nthe following forms: \\n\\uf0b7 Natural language displayed on screen \\n\\uf0b7 Verbal narrations in natural language'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  44 \\n\\uf0b7 Listing of rule numbers displayed on the screen.  \\nThe user interface makes it easy to trace the credibility of the deductions. \\nRequirements of Efficient ES User Interface  \\n\\uf0b7 It should help users to accomplish their goals in shortest possible ay. \\n\\uf0b7 It should be designed to work for user’s existing or desired work practices. \\n\\uf0b7 Its technology should be adaptable to user’s requirements; not the other way round.  \\n\\uf0b7 It should make efficient use of user input. \\nExpert Systems Limitations \\nNo technology can offer easy and complete solution.

They are connected \\nto other thousand cells by Axons. Stimuli from external environment or inputs from sensory \\norgans are accepted by dendrites. These inputs create electric impulses, which quickly travel \\nthrough the neural network. A neuron can then send the message to other neuron to handle  \\nthe issue or does not send it forward. \\n \\nANNs are composed of multiple nodes, which imitate biological neurons of human brain. The \\nneurons are connected by links and they interact with each other. The nodes can take input \\n10. Neural Networks'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  54 \\ndata and perform simple operation s on the data. The result of these operations is passed t o \\nother neurons. The output at each node is called its activation or node value. \\nEach link is associated with weight. ANNs are capable of learning, which takes place by \\naltering weight values. The following illustration shows a simple ANN: \\n \\nT ypes of Artificial Neural Networks \\nThere are two Artificial Neural Network topologies: FeedForward and Feedback. \\nFeedForward ANN \\nIn this ANN, the information flow is unidirectional. A unit sends information to other unit from \\nwhich it does not receive any information. There are no feedback loops. They are used in \\npattern generation/recognition/classification. They have fixed inputs and outputs. \\n \\nFeedback ANN \\nHere, feedback loops are allowed. They are used in content addressable memories.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  55 \\n \\nWorking of ANNs  \\nIn the topology diagrams shown , each arrow represents a connection between two neurons \\nand indicates the pathway for the flow of information. Each connection has a weight, an integer \\nnumber that controls the signal between the two neurons.  \\nIf the network generates a “good or desired” output, there is no need to adjust the weights. \\nHowever, if the network generates a “poor or undesired” output or an error, then the system \\nalters the weights in order to improve subsequent results. \\nMachine Learning in ANNs \\nANNs are capable of learning  and they need to be trained . There are several learning \\nstrategies: \\n\\uf0b7 Supervised Learning: It involves a teacher that is scholar than the ANN itself. For \\nexample, the teacher feeds some example data about which the teacher already knows \\nthe answers.  \\nFor example, pattern recognizing. The ANN comes up with guesses while recognizing. \\nThen the teacher provides the ANN with the answers. The network then compares it \\nguesses with the teacher’s “correct” answers and makes adjustments according to \\nerrors.  \\n\\uf0b7 Unsupervised Learning: It is required when there is no example data set with known \\nanswers. For example, searching for a hidden pattern . In this case, clustering i.e.  \\ndividing a set of elements into groups according to some unknown pattern  is carried \\nout based on the existing data sets present.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  56 \\n\\uf0b7 Reinforcement Learning : This strategy built on observation. The ANN  makes a \\ndecision by observing its environment . If  the observation is negative, the ne twork \\nadjusts its weights to be able to make a different required decision the next time.  \\nBack Propagation Algorithm \\nIt is the training or learning algorithm. It learns by example. If you submit to the algorithm \\nthe example of what you want the network to do, it changes the network’s weights so that it \\ncan produce desired output for a particular input on finishing the training.  \\nBack Propagation networks are ideal for simple Pattern Recognition and Mapping Tasks . \\nBayesian Networks (BN) \\nThese are the graphi cal structures used to represent the probabilistic relationship among a \\nset of random variables. Bayesian networks are also called Belief Networks or Bayes Nets. \\nBNs reason about uncertain domain. \\nIn these networks, each node represents a random variable  with specific propositions . For \\nexample, in a medical diagnosis domain, the node Cancer represents the proposition that a \\npatient has cancer.  \\nThe edges connecting the nodes represent probabilistic dependencies among those random \\nvariables. If out of two nodes, one is affecting the other then they must be directly connected \\nin the directions of the effect. The strength of the relationship between variables is quantified \\nby the probability associated with each node. \\nThere is an only constraint on the arcs in a BN that you cannot return to a node simply by \\nfollowing directed arcs. Hence the BNs are called Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). \\nBNs are capable of handling multivalued variables simultaneously. The BN variables are \\ncomposed of two dimensions:  \\n1. Range of prepositions \\n2. Probability assigned to each of the prepositions. \\nConsider a finite set X = {X1, X2, …,Xn} of discrete random variables, where each variable  Xi \\nmay take values from a finite set, denoted by  Val(Xi). If there is a directed link from \\nvariable Xi to variable, Xj, then variable  Xi will be a parent of variable  Xj showing direct \\ndependencies between the variables.  \\nThe structure of BN is ideal for combining prior knowledge and observed data. BN can be used \\nto learn the causal relationships and underst and various problem domains and to predict \\nfuture events, even in case of missing data. \\nBuilding a Bayesian Network \\nA knowledge engineer can build a Bayesian network.

In which state can they be?  \\nFor now let us consider nodes, with only discrete values. The variable must take on exactly \\none of these values at a time.  \\nCommon types of discrete nodes are:  \\n• Boolean nodes: They represent propositions, taking binary values TRUE (T) and FALSE \\n(F).  \\n• Ordered values: A node Pollution might represent and take values from {low, medium, \\nhigh} describing degree of a patient’s exposure to pollution.  \\n• Integral values: A node called Age might represent patient’s age with possible values \\nfrom 1 to 120. Even at this early stage, modeling choices are being made.  \\nPossible nodes and values for the lung cancer example: \\nNode Name Type Value \\n \\nPollution Binary {LOW, HIGH, MEDIUM} \\nSmoker Boolean {TRUE, FASLE} \\nLung-Cancer Boolean {TRUE, FASLE} \\nX-Ray Binary {Positive, Negative} \\n \\nCreate Arcs between Nodes \\nTopology of the network should capture qualitative relationships between variables.  \\nFor example, what causes a pa tient to have lung cancer? - Pollution and smoking. Then add \\narcs from node Pollution and node Smoker to node Lung-Cancer.  \\nSimilarly if patient has lung cancer, then X-ray result will be positive . Then add arcs from \\nLung-Cancer to X-Ray.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Artificial Intelligence  \\n  58 \\n \\nSpecify Topology \\nConventionally, BNs are laid out so that the arcs point from top to bottom. The set of parent \\nnodes of a node X is given by Parents(X). \\nThe Lung-Cancer node has two parents  (reasons or causes) :  Pollution and Smoker, while \\nnode Smoker is an ancestor of node X-Ray. Similarly, X-Ray is a child (consequence or \\neffects) of node Lung-Cancer and successor of nodes Smoker and Pollution.  \\nConditional Probabilities  \\nNow quantify the relation ships between connected nodes: this is done by specifying a \\nconditional probability distribution for each node. As only discrete variables are considered \\nhere, this takes the form of a Conditional Probability Table (CPT).  \\nFirst, for each node we need to look at all the possible combinations of values of those parent \\nnodes. Each such combination is called an instantiation of the parent set. For each distinct \\ninstantiation of parent node values, we need to specify the probability that the child will take.  \\nFor ex ample, the Lung-Cancer node’s parents are Pollution and Smoking. They take the \\npossible values = { (H,T), ( H,F), (L,T), (L,F)}.
